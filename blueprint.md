# Video and Audio Compression App Blueprint

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a native mobile application that provides video and audio compression capabilities. The app will be built using Flutter and will integrate the FFMPEG library to handle the compression tasks seamlessly. The user interface will be designed based on the visual guide provided in the `images` folder.

## Key Features

*   **Video Compression:** Allows users to select videos from their device and compress them to a smaller file size.
*   **Audio Compression:** Enables users to compress audio files, reducing their storage footprint.
*   **Intuitive UI:** A user-friendly interface designed for a smooth and straightforward experience.
*   **Cross-Platform:** The app will be available on both Android and iOS, thanks to Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Set up a new Flutter project.
    *   Configure the necessary dependencies.
2.  **UI Mockup Implementation:**
    *   Develop the app's user interface based on the provided UI guide in the `images` folder.
    *   Ensure the UI is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
3.  **Basic Navigation:**
    *   Implement the basic navigation flow between different screens.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

1.  **FFMPEG Integration:**
    *   Integrate a reliable FFMPEG package for Flutter.
    *   Set up the necessary configurations for both Android and iOS.
2.  **File Selection:**
    *   Implement file pickers to allow users to select video and audio files from their device's storage.
3.  **Compression Logic:**
    *   Develop the core compression logic using FFMPEG commands.
    *   Provide options for different compression levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
4.  **Progress Indication:**
    *   Display a progress indicator to show the status of the compression process.

### Phase 3: Final Touches

1.  **File Management:**
    *   Implement functionality to save the compressed files to the device.
    *   Add options for sharing the compressed files through other apps.
2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling to manage issues like unsupported file formats or compression failures.
3.  **Testing and Optimization:**
    *   Thoroughly test the app on both Android and iOS devices.
    *   Optimize the app's performance for a smooth user experience.
